          My name is Stacy. I am a full-stack developer in training. I own my own business where I have spent the last 6 years of my career in I.T. for software companies.
          I wanted to expand my business to include or migrate to coding, more specifically, web development.

          I love the outdoors, traveling to historic places, and trying new cuisine.
          I also love art, creating it, finding it, and decorating with it. In my spare time, I like to paint landscapes and refinish antique furniture.
